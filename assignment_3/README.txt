Problems:
1) i don't know if it is just my environment or something
    wrong with my code, but  I get a malloc tcache error
    and the executable fails to run about 50% of the time.
    usually I can just keep trying to run it and it will 
    eventually work.... So if you get that error, just know
    that the code works sometimes.

2) did not implement a particle chain or cloth simulation. Could not figure out how to do it.

3) I tried implementing a new spring / particle class but could not get that code to work with the starter code


suggestions:
1) I don't think there's enough information in the homework handout and in the slides to successfully solve this assignment. 
    I used 2 text books and many online references to see how particles are implemented with ODE's, integrators, and time steppers.
    I still couldn't figure out how to successfully use the evalF function, as when I implemented my custom particle & spring solution inside evalF,
    evalF would just fail.
